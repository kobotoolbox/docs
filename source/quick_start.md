Here's how to quickly get started with a **new form**, deploy it as a **survey
project**, and **start collecting data** in the field.

## Creating an account and signing in

To get started, go to the
[**Sign up page**](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/sign-up/) and create an account
on one of our public servers. Most users sign up for an account on our
[**Global KoboToolbox Server**](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/). Users and
organizations that require or prefer data hosting in the European Union can sign
up for an account on the
[**European Union KoboToolbox Server**](https://eu.kobotoolbox.org/).

Once you have created your account, activate your account using the emailed
link. You can then sign in to your account via the server URL or the
[**Sign up page**](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/sign-up/).

For more information about signing up for an account, please see the support
article [Creating an account on KoboToolbox](creating_account.md).
