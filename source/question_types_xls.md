# Question types in XLSForm
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/2afa3a0c670fe98b296a79b798f33abf248d0273/source/question_types_xls.md" class="reference">Oct 10, 2025</a>

When adding questions to an XLSForm, you'll need to choose the appropriate **question type**. The question type will depend on the kind of information you want to collect: some question types are more suited for text, others for numbers, dates, or multiple choice inputs.

The question type in XLSForm is entered in the **type** column of the **survey** worksheet. Always use the exact spelling and letter case. You can add additional [appearances](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/appearances_xls.html) to most question types to modify their display or functionality.

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> While XLSForm is fully integrated within KoboToolbox, some question types have different names and functionalities in the <a href="https://support.kobotoolbox.org/formbuilder.html">Formbuilder</a> than they do in XLSForm. 
</p>

This article covers available question types in XLSForm, including their descriptions and Formbuilder equivalents. Links are provided at the end of each section for more information on question type functionalities and appearances during data collection.
