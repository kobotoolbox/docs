**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/511ea4cb3c698a4b45e7c2b4efd1af4e356e811f/source/howto_edit_single_submissions.md" class="reference">15 Feb 2022</a>

To edit or delete a submitted questionnaire, please follow the steps below.

Please note:

-   If you're collecting data with the KoboCollect app, once a form has been
    submitted to the server it is **not possible** to edit or delete a
    submission from KoboCollect.
-   It is **not possible** to do bulk edit or deletions.

1. Open the _DATA_ tab of your project, and then click on _Table_ on the left.
   You will see two icon options to either **Open** or **Edit** a record in the
   first column of the data table.

2. You can view, validate, edit, or delete submissions by clicking the **OPEN**
   icon to open the _Submission Record_ modal. Or you can click the **EDIT**
   icon to go directly to editing the submitted form.

    **NOTE: DELETING IS NOT REVERSIBLE.**
