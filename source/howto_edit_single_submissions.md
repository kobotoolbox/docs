**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/01270a828ec846731411368326ba58114adda98e/source/howto_edit_single_submissions.md" class="reference">28 Oct 2025</a>


To edit or delete a submitted questionnaire, please follow the steps below.

Please note that if you are collecting data with the [KoboCollect app](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/data_collection_kobocollect.html), once a form has been
    submitted to the server it is **not possible** to edit or delete a
    submission from KoboCollect.

1. Open the _DATA_ tab of your project, and then click on _Table_ on the left.
   You will see two icon options to either **Open** or **Edit** a record in the
   first column of the data table.

2. You can view, validate, edit, or delete submissions by clicking the **OPEN**
   icon to open the _Submission Record_ modal. Or you can click the **EDIT**
   icon to go directly to editing the submitted form.

    **NOTE: DELETING IS NOT REVERSIBLE.**
