# Restricting Text Responses With Regular Expressions

A regular expression, or regex, is a search pattern used for matching specific characters and ranges of characters within a string. It is widely used to validate, search, extract, and restrict text in most programming languages. KoBoToolbox supports regex to control the length and characters during data entry to a particular question _(e.g. controlling the entry of mobile number to exactly 10 digits, controlling the entry of a valid email id etc.)_.

#### To use a regex in KoBoToolbox, follow these steps

1. Prepare a _Text_ question type.

2. Go to the question's _Settings_.

3. Go to _Validation Criteria_ and choose the _Manually enter your validation logic in XLSForm_ code option.

4. In the _Validation Code_ box, enter your regex formula between the quotation marks `(' ')` of the `regex(., ' ')` format. For reference, the period (`.`) refers to _'this question'_, while the regular expression inside the quotation marks (`' '`) needs to conform to the established regex rules.

5. (Optional) Add a custom _Error Message_ for the person entering data to see when they don't meet the regex criteria.

Regex can also be coded in XLSForm, under the _constraint_ column:

| type | name | label                       | appearance | constraint            | constraint_message                 |
| ---  | ---  | ---                         | ---        | ---                   | ---                                |
| text | q1   | Mobile number of respondent | numbers    | regex(., '^[0-9]{10}$')        | This value must be only 10 digits  |

Alternatively, you can create a `calculate` question type and then define the regex code under the _calculation_ column. You could then use this variable as many times as needed in the survey:

| type      | name | label                  | calculation                              | constraint      | constraint_message                  |
| ---       | ---  | ---                    | ---                                      | ---             | ---                                 |
| calculate | q0   |                        | '^[A-Z]{1}[a-z]{1,}\s[A-Z]{1}[a-z]{1,}$' |                 |                                     |
| text      | q1   | Name of the Enumerator |                                          | regex(., ${q0}) | Please use this format: Kobe Bryant |
| text      | q2   | Name of the Respondent |                                          | regex(., ${q0}) | Please use this format: Kobe Bryant |
| integer   | q3   | Age of the Respondent  |                                          |                 |                                     |

<p class="note">Regex in KoBoToolbox should always be written in-between the apostrophes <code>regex(., ' ')</code> as shown in the examples.</p>

#### Considerations when using regex

* If you wish to use a regex constraint on a number in a `text` type question, make sure you _always_ have the value `numbers` under the `appearance` column. This restricts the display of alphabets, making only numbers visible for inputs.

* The Collect Android app and Enketo behave differently with their handling of regex expressions. Collect behaves as if you have used the anchors `^` and `$` around the expression (even if you have not used them), while Enketo requires the anchors as mandatory for an exact match.
