**Simple step-by-step process to export and upload your data as a shapefile into
GIS software, such as ArcMap.**

There are multiple ways to import location-based data collected through
KoboToolbox into GIS software. This article will outline a recommended procedure
to download data from KoboToolbox as a CSV file and upload it into ArcMap as a
shapefile. While this example uses ArcMap, the process is similar to those in
other geospatial softwares, including QGIS (free).

1. In the **Downloads** tab of your project page in KoboToolbox, export and
   download your data as a CSV file.

    _Note: You can edit the data set once its in the GIS software, however it
    may be easier to first edit in Excel, or similar program. In Excel, use the
    [Text to Columns.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/split-a-cell-f1804d0c-e180-4ed0-a2ae-973a0b7c6a23)
    function to split your CSV data into individual cells._

2. Open a new or existing project in ArcMap, go to **Add Data**, and then link
   the folder where your CSV file is saved on your computer.

3. Open the **Catalog** window and click on **Folder Connections**. Find your
   CSV file, right click it, then select **Create Feature Class** > **From XY
   Table**.

4. In the modal, click the **X Field** drop down and chose your GPS
   question_Longitude option. Also, be sure to choose your **Coordinate System
   of Input Coordinates**...(WGS 1984 is a good one, if you're not using one
   already) and make sure your **Output** is set to the appropriate folder, then
   click **OK**.

5. Back in the **Catalog** window, click and drag your new shapefile into either
   the **Data View** window or **Table of Contents**.

6. You should now see your points on the screen and if you open the **Attributes
   Table**, you'll see all of the associated data with each point. From this
   point, you can now visualize and run various spatial analyses with your data.
