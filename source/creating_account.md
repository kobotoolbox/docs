**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/3f98ef1e3a2fac6bfbeb92b4af9c7fefb28d8d41/source/creating_account.md" class="reference">7 Jul 2025</a>

The first step for all users when getting started with **KoboToolbox** is to
create an account. This article will guide you through the steps for creating an
account and signing in to your account.

## How to access KoboToolbox

There are three ways to access **KoboToolbox**:

1. **Public servers**: Most users access **KoboToolbox** using one of the public
   servers listed on the [Sign up page](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/sign-up/).
   The **Global KoboToolbox Server** is used by the majority of our users. The
   **European Union KoboToolbox Server** is hosted in Ireland and is used by
   organizations that require or prefer data hosting in the European Union (EU).
1. **Private servers**: Many large organizations have their own private
   KoboToolbox server. If your organization has a private server, you can access
   your account via your organization's server URL.
1. **Install KoboToolbox on your own server**: Advanced users can install
   **KoboToolbox** on their own server or on a local computer or device using Docker. For more
   details on how to install your own instance of **KoboToolbox**,
   [visit our kobo-install repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install).

## Creating an account

The **Global KoboToolbox Server** is used by the majority of our users.

The **European Union KoboToolbox Server** is hosted in Ireland and is used by
organizations that require or prefer data hosting in the EU.

<p class="note">
  <b>Important note</b>: It is not possible to share projects and data between the two servers. This means that all users working on a shared project must use the same server to access the project.
</p>

- Click **CREATE AN ACCOUNT** on the server of your choice.
- On the **Create an account** page, enter the details on the form and click
  **CREATE ACCOUNT**.

<p class="note">
  Make sure to keep your password in a safe place to avoid losing it. <br />
  The username must be all lowercase letters, without any spaces or symbols.
</p>

**KoboToolbox** will send you an email with a link to activate your account. If
you did not get the activation email, check your spam folder. For more help, you
can also read the support article
[Didnâ€™t Receive Activation Link After Signing Up](activation_link.md).

- Sign in to the email address you used when creating your account and click the
  activation link sent to you. This will automatically sign you into
  **KoboToolbox**.

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure to follow the guidelines listed below to create a valid username:
   - The length of a username can range from 2 to 30 characters.
   - A username could be made up of a combination of lower-case characters,
     numbers, and underscores. Use of special characters (such as `~`, `!`, `@`,
     `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `?`) are not valid.
   - The username must start with a lower-case character.
2. You may be required to choose another username (despite following all the
   points listed above) if the username has already been registered to another
   user.
3. [Choose a strong password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-and-use-strong-passwords-c5cebb49-8c53-4f5e-2bc4-fe357ca048eb)
   so that your account and sensitive data is less vulnerable to attack or
   abuse.
4. Store your username and password in a safe place, such as a password manager,
   so that you don't lose access to your account.
5. Ensure the entered email address is correct otherwise you will not receive
   the activation link.
