# Introduction to XLSForm

KoboToolbox relies on [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org/en/), a standard for designing electronic forms in Excel or other spreadsheet programs. XLSForm makes it easier to manage complex forms, such as those with long choice lists or multiple translations. While the [KoboToolbox Formbuilder](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/formbuilder.html) offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface, XLSForm is recommended when working with advanced functionalities or complex forms.

All forms in KoboToolbox are fully compatible with XLSForm. This means you can easily import and export your forms across KoboToolbox and other data collection platforms. XLSForm provides a standardized format for form development using common spreadsheet software, making it a practical option for collaboration and sharing.

## Benefits of using XLSForm

XLSForm provides numerous benefits for building both simple and complex data collection forms.

### Efficient form building and editing

XLSForm leverages familiar spreadsheet features for efficient form creation and modification. You can use Excel formulas and functionalities such as copy-pasting, dragging, Find and Replace, sorting, and filtering to quickly build and manage large forms.

### Choice list management for multiple choice questions

XLSForm makes it easy to create and manage [choice lists](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/option_choices_xls.html). You can copy long lists directly from external sources, reuse the same options across multiple questions, or duplicate them across forms, saving time, ensuring consistency, and reducing manual errors.

### Version control and collaboration

XLSForm simplifies sharing and managing form versions. As forms are Excel or Google Sheets files, teams can collaborate on them in real-time, share them for review, and maintain version records.

### Form customization

XLSForm allows you to fully tailor your forms to different needs. You can add and manage [multiple translations](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/language_xls.html) directly in your XLSForm to support multilingual data collection. You can easily set up complex form structures, such as [question groups](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/grouping_questions_xls.html) or [repeating sections](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/repeat_groups_xls.html). Additionally, you can connect your form to [external data sources](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/pull_data_kobotoolbox.html) and [other KoboToolbox projects](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/dynamic_data_attachment.html).

### Advanced functionalities

XLSForm makes it easier to use advanced form building functionalities, such as [skip logic](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/skip_logic_xls.html), [calculations](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/calculations_xls.html), and [constraints](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/constraints_xls.html). As an open standard, XLSForm also offers access to features that may not yet be supported by the KoboToolbox Formbuilder.

## Using XLSForm with KoboToolbox

XLSForm seamlessly integrates with KoboToolbox for form building, previewing, editing, and deployment for data collection.

Users can begin in the KoboToolbox Formbuilder by creating a new form and adding questions, then [download their form as an XLSForm](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/xlsform_with_kobotoolbox.html#downloading-an-xlsform-from-kobotoolbox) for further customization. This provides a structured foundation, which can be useful for new projects or users with less form building experience.

Forms created in XLSForm can then be uploaded to KoboToolbox for previewing, testing, editing, and deployment. Forms can be reviewed for errors and easily modified in KoboToolbox, such as changing the title or settings.
