If you have XLS exports stuck in the pending state, remove the stuck exports by clicking on the red trash can icon for each one. Next, retry the exports by clicking the "New Export" button. Please note that any export stuck in the "Pending" state for longer than an hour will likely never succeed; if you encounter such an export, please feel free to delete it and create a new export.

You should not have any trouble creating new exports from this point forward, but if you do, please don't hesitate to let us know.
