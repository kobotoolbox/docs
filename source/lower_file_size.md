## KoboCollect

In KoboCollect, when you take a photo, you will now be asked which app should be

again.

## Open Camera

In the Open Camera settings, go to Photo Settings, then:

1. Open Camera Resolution and choose the smallest acceptable resolution.
2. Open image quality and choose a percentage: 90% will look almost perfect,
   below 50% the image will become harder to recognize. Start with 70% and test
   some images at different quality levels to find the lowest acceptable size.
