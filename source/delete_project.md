# Deleting a Project
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/050dcc9c8bfb4c528208bbe886979999037f1554/source/delete_project.md" class="reference">28 Oct 2025</a>
Please note that once a project has been deleted, **THE ACTION CANNOT BE
REVERSED**. We do not store copies of your deleted projects, so make sure that
you have the correct project before proceeding and have all the data downloaded
first, if needed.

## Deleting Projects From Your Project Dashboard

In the Project Dashboard page hover over the far right side of the project you
wish to delete. Click the three dot icon (circled) that appears and then click
Delete. A dialogue box will appear that will require you to read and check a set
warnings, before deleting the project from your KoboToolbox account.
