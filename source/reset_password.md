# Resetting passwords

KoBoToolbox sends out password reminder emails immediately after you request to reset it. If you have requested to reset your password and you didn't receive an email with the password reminder link, please try the following:

   * Check if our password reset email landed in your spam or junk mail folder, as it might have been placed there by your email provider.  
   * Check if you created your account with a different email address - simply click on the 'Forgot' link again and enter your alternative email address.  
   
It is possible you are trying to access the account on the wrong server (there are two separate instances of KoBoToolbox for humanitarians and other users - kobo.humanitarianresponse.info and kf.kobotoolbox.org).

If you still have not received the email with the reset link please send an email to support@kobotoolbox.org with your username, the email address you used to sign up, and which server you created your account on (kf.kobotoolbox.org or kobo.humanitarianresponse.info).
