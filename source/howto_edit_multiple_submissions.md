# Editing Responses in Multiple Submissions

Users could always edit submissions as outlined in our support article [Editing or Deleting a Single Submission](howto_edit_single_submissions.md). What if a user has to edit repeated typo errors or update missing responses for all or most of the submissions from a particular survey project? Following the method outlined earlier should consume much time. Hence, KoBoToolbox has developed a feature that should make editing straightforward, saving editing time.

#### Editing filled-up responses for multiple submissions

The following is a screen generally seen for **DATA>Table**.

The image shared above shows data input variance with the variable/question **Country** ranging from _America_, _U.S.A_, _US_, _United States of America_, _United States_, _usa_ to _USA_. This section of the support article should outline _how to change all these varying **Country** names to **USA**_.

##### Step 1: 

To start editing responses for multiple submissions, users should either select a single record (marked **1**) or select multiple records (marked **2**). Selecting as shown in the image below should activate the edit features along with other features.

   * **1.** Users could select multiple records that require bulk editing.
   * **2.** Alternative to approach outlined above (in **1**), users could select _all records_ or _all visible records_ under **DATA>Table**. _All records_ refer to the entire records that are present within the survey project while _all visible records_ refer to 30 records that are by default visible under **DATA>Table**. Users should clearly distinguish between the two when there are more than 30 records (submissions) within the survey project.
   * **3.** Shows the total number of records selected for _changing/updating the validation status_, _bulk editing_ or _bulk deletion_.
   * **4.** Users could bulk change the validation status as outlined in our support article [Record Validation](record_validation.md).
   * **5.** Users could bulk edit the responses for multiple submissions.
   * **6.** Users could bulk delete the records.

##### Step 2:

Users will now have to press **Edit** (**5** as shown in the image above) for bulk editing after selecting all the records that require modifications. The following dialogue box should then appear.

Users could filter the required question by typing it in the search filter located just below the **Question** header.

Users should see _Multiple responses_ under the **Response** header (shown in the above image) if different values entered. Here we have a range of inputs from _America_, _U.S.A_, _US_, _United States of America_, _United States_, _usa_ to _USA_. However, if users select a single record and press **Edit**, they would see the following dialogue box.

Users could now filter the required response by typing it in the search filter located just below the **Response** header. This approach is useful when a userâ€™s wishes to edit a single record.

##### Step 3:

Users could press the **EDIT** button once it is known _what to edit and where to edit_.

##### Step 4:

So now, there are two approaches to make bulk edits. _Approach 1_ is when users type in the required text (**USA** in our case) in the blank box (marked **1.1**) and then press **SAVE** (marked **2**). _Approach 2_ is when users press **SELECT** (marked **1.2**) for an appropriate text and then press **SAVE** (marked **2**).

##### Step 5:

A dialogue box now appears. Users will now have to press **CONFIRM & CLOSE** to save the changes made.

![image](/images/howto_edit_multiple_submissions/Image_9.png)

Users could always go back to **DATA>Table** and check if the bulk edits were successful.

#### Editing blank responses for multiple submissions

Sometimes, there may be a scenario when users have to add a question at the middle or end of the survey. In such a case, the survey data from the **DATA>Table** should see, as shown in the image below.

![image](/images/howto_edit_multiple_submissions/Image_11.png)

This section of the support article should outline _how to change all these empty states to **Alabama**_. 

##### Step 1: 

To start editing blank responses for multiple submissions, users should select multiple records (marked **1**) and then press **Edit** (marked **2**). 

![image](/images/howto_edit_multiple_submissions/Image_12.png)

##### Step 2:

Users will now have to press **Edit** (as shown in the image below), which is in a parallel line straight to _State_ as we are updating the empty states for all the records. 

![image](/images/howto_edit_multiple_submissions/Image_13.png)

##### Step 3:

In this case, users should type in the required text (**Alabama** in our case) in the blank box (marked **1**) and then press **SAVE** (marked **2**). 

![image](/images/howto_edit_multiple_submissions/Image_14.png)

##### Step 4:

A dialogue box appears. Users will now have to press **CONFIRM & CLOSE** to save the changes made.

![image](/images/howto_edit_multiple_submissions/Image_15.png)

Users could always go back to **DATA>Table** and check if the bulk edits were successful.
