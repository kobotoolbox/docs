After you create your account, an activation link will be sent to the email address you provided. You must click this link within 72 hours to activate your account.

If you do not click the link within three days, or if the link has expired:
1. Try logging in with the username and password you created. A new activation link should be sent automatically.
2. If that does not work, the issue may be caused by:
    * A typo in the email address you entered.
    * Your organization’s email domain blocking our messages.
    * The activation email being placed in your spam or junk folder.
3. If you still cannot access your account, please contact us at [support@kobotoolbox.org](support@kobotoolbox.org).
