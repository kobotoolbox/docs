# Troubleshooting account activation link 
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/050dcc9c8bfb4c528208bbe886979999037f1554/source/activation_link.md" class="reference">28 Oct 2025</a>

If you do not click the link within three days, or if the link has expired:
1. Try logging in with the username and password you created. A new activation link should be sent automatically.
2. If that does not work, the issue may be caused by:
    * A typo in the email address you entered.
    * Your organizationâ€™s email domain blocking our messages.
    * The activation email being placed in your spam or junk folder.
3. If you still cannot access your account, please contact us at [support@kobotoolbox.org](support@kobotoolbox.org).
