# Getting started with KoBoToolbox

Last updated Dec 9, 2021
The first thing you need to do to start using KoBoToolbox is to create an account. This guide will teach you the steps to create your account on one of KoBoToolbox servers and access it.

## How to access KoBoToolbox

There are two main ways of accessing KoBoToolbox.

For most users, it is recommended to use any of the publicly available Kobotoolbox servers listed on the [Get Started page](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/#sign-up). The method of creating an account is documented below.

On the other hand, advanced users can install KoBoToolbox on their own server (or on a local machine) using Docker. For more details on how to install your own instance of Kobotoolbox, [visit our kobo-install repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install).

## Creating an account

-   To create a new account on KoBoToolbox, go to the [KoBoToolbox homepage](https://kobotoolbox.org) and click SIGN UP on the menu. This will take you to the Get Started section of the website.

-   Here, you are presented with two different servers where you can create your account.

If you are an individual researcher, aid worker, or a for-profit organization, it is recommended to use the server provided by Kobotoolbox.

If you are creating an account for a humanitarian organization, it is recommended that you use the server provided by UN OCHA.

To read more about the differences between the two servers, [read this support article](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/server.html).

-   Click **CREATE ACCOUNT** on the server of your choice

<p class='note'>The username must be all lowercase letters and without any spaces and symbols.<br/><br/>
Make sure to keep your password in a safe place to avoid losing it.</p>

Kobotoolbox will send you an email with a link to activate your account. If you did not get the activation email, read this support article [Didn’t Receive Activation Link After Signing Up](activation_link.md).
