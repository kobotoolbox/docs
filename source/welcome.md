## Using the question library

Standardize data and streamline form building by creating form templates and using questions from the Public Collections library.

* **My Library:** Create, organize, and save custom questions and templates in your library.
* **Public Collections:** Use a question, block of questions, or entire form template from the [Public Collections library](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/using_public_collections.html) in your form and customize it as needed. Questions and templates in the public library are contributed by other users and available to everyone.
