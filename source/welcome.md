KoboToolbox makes it easy to develop forms for data collection. It also has features for managing projects, visualizing data, and building complex forms. This article provides a quick overview of a few KoboToolbox basics.

## Developing forms

With KoboToolbox’s powerful and intuitive [Formbuilder](formbuilder.md), you can build forms with different question types, advanced form logic, and [XLSForm](getting_started_xlsform.md).

- **Question types:** Choose from 25 qualitative and quantitative [question types](](question_types.md)), including text, multiple choice, media, and GPS.
- **Form logic:** Use skip logic, calculations, and validations for high quality data.
- **XLSForm:** To create more complex forms, use [XLSForm](https://xlsform.org/en/) in Excel or Google Sheets, upload to KoboToolbox, and edit directly in the KoboToolbox Formbuilder.
- **Translations:** Easily [add translations](language_dashboard.md) of your forms in hundreds of different languages.

## Using the question library

Standardize data and streamline form building by creating form templates and using questions from the [Public Collections library](using_public_collections.md).

![Library](/images/welcome/library.png)

- **My Library:** Create, organize, and save custom questions and templates in your library.
- **Public Collections:** Use a question, block of questions, or entire form template from the Public Collections library in your form and customize it as needed. Questions and templates in the public library are contributed by other users and are available to everyone.

## Collecting data

Collect data offline or online [on any device](data-collection-tools.) with web forms and the KoboCollect app.
