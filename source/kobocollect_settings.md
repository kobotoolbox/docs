**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/2afa3a0c670fe98b296a79b798f33abf248d0273/source/article_template.md" class="reference">6 Sep 2025</a>

KoboCollect is a free, open-source KoboToolbox app designed for data collection on Android mobile devices. Before you get started, install and configure the KoboCollect app. Once [installed and configured](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/kobocollect_on_android_latest.html), you can customize the app based on your project or user needs. Project settings allow you to:
- Adjust the **user interface** (e.g., language, font size, theme)
- Configure **map settings** for location-based questions
- Manage how forms are handled (e.g., auto-send, finalize, editing rules)
- Set the **user and device** identity for tracking submissions
- Protect access to the app and its settings with **passwords or admin controls**
  
To access the settings menu:

1. Tap the **Project icon** to open the menu.
2. Tap **Settings**.

  <strong>Note:</strong> Users do not need an internet connection to access or change project settings in KoboCollect.

## Project display settings
In the KoboCollect app, you can [connect to multiple KoboToolbox accounts](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/kobocollect_on_android_latest.html/#Setting-up-multiple-projects-in-KoboCollect). User accounts are called **Projects** in KoboCollect. 

To customize how each project is displayed for easier recognition and switching, you can edit the **project display** settings. These changes only affect how the project appears in the deviceâ€™s interface and do not affect the data or other devices.
