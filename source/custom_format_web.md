When using Web Forms (Enketo) as your data collection method, you have the
option to format your question labels in several ways.

To format your note text, use one of these options:

-   _emphasize words_ by wrapping them inside `_these_` or `*these characters*`
-   **strongly emphasize** words by wrapping them inside `__these characters__`
    or `**these**`
-   [a link](https://www.kobotoolbox.org) can be added by using
    `[a link](https://www.kobotoolbox.org)`

These formattings will not work in KoboCollect, which will just show the `_` or
`*` characters along with the text.

## Combining text and media by 'combining' subsequent notes

You can already include an image, video, or audio file in your questions. (This
works both in Web forms and in KoboCollect.) But when using Web Forms, you can
choose to show the image next to the text, for example, simply by adding two
subsequent notes. To learn more about this process, please
[see this post](https://blog.enketo.org/better-notes).
