The KoboToolbox Formbuilder is a user-friendly tool for designing and deploying data collection forms. This article provides a basic overview of its functions, from adding and managing questions to organizing your form.

<p class="note">
    To learn how to create a new form in KoboToolbox, see the KoboToolbox <a href="https://support.kobotoolbox.org/quick_start.html">Quickstart overview</a>.
</p>

## Adding a question

To add a question to your form, click the <i class="k-icon k-icon-plus"></i> button that is below every question. Enter your question label and click **Add Question**. Then,
[choose the question type](question_types.md).

For [Select One or Select Many](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/select_one_and_select_many.html) question types, add the response options below the question.

<p class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: Once the question type has been selected, it cannot be changed in the Formbuilder. To change the question type of an existing question, delete the question and create a new question with the same label.
</p>

## Adding a question hint

A question hint provides additional instructions below the question text in the form. To add a question hint, click on **Question hint** below the question and type in your hint.

## Duplicating a question

To duplicate a question, click <i class="k-icon-duplicate"></i> **Duplicate Question** in the question menu on the right. An exact copy will appear directly below the original.

## Deleting a question

To remove a question, click <i class="k-icon-trash"></i> **Delete Question** in the question menu on the right. You will be asked to confirm before it is permanently deleted from your form.

## Changing question settings

To access advanced question settings, click on <i class="k-icon-settings"></i> **Settings** in the question menu on the right. Here, you can add skip logic, validation criteria, guidance hints, and make a question required. 

<p class="note">
To learn more about question settings, see <a href="https://support.kobotoolbox.org/question_options.html">Using the question options</a>, <a href="https://support.kobotoolbox.org/skip_logic.html">Adding skip logic in the Formbuilder</a>, and <a href="https://support.kobotoolbox.org/validation_criteria.html">Adding validation criteria in the Formbuilder</a>.
</p>

## Adding questions to the library

To save a question for reuse in future forms, click <i class="k-icon-folder-plus"></i> **Add Question to Library**. It will be saved as a copy in your [question library](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/question_library.html). You can modify or delete the original question in your form without affecting the copy in the library.

## Grouping your questions

Questions can be [grouped together](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/group_repeat.html) to organize your form. Select questions using the **CTRL** key (Windows) or **Command** key (Mac), then click <i class="k-icon k-icon-group"></i> **Create group with selected questions** in the top left menu bar.

## Changing the order of your questions

Questions and groups can be moved to any position in the form. Drag-and-drop a question or group from its current position to where you want it to go.

## Previewing your form

After adding all questions to your form, click <i class="k-icon k-icon-view"></i> **Preview form** to see how it will appear once deployed.

## Saving your form

As you edit your form, regularly click **SAVE** in the top right corner of your screen to ensure your work is saved. An asterisk (*) will appear next to the **SAVE** button when you have unsaved changes.
