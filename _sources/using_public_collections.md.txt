# Using Public Collections
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/050dcc9c8bfb4c528208bbe886979999037f1554/source/using_public_collections.md" class="reference">28 Oct 2025</a>
**Public Collections** helps us all improve our data collection by making sets
of predefined survey questions public and easily accessible to the entire Kobo
community. Anyone can create, find, and use these collections freely, enabling
teams and organizations to standardize their surveys as well as allowing them to
contribute to the work and best practices of others. These collections can
contain individual questions, blocks of questions, or full survey templates that
are ready to be used.

This article describes in detail where to find, how to use, and how to
contribute to the **Public Collections** library.

## Purpose of the Public Collections

Users can choose to make their survey questions public, meaning they will be
included in the **Public Collections** library. All users on the
[same server instance](creating_account.md) will have access to the same **Public
Collections**, which may include common questions or groups of questions, such
as demographic characteristics, DHS (Demographic & Health Surveillance), equity
tool for wealth determination, as well as other standard measures widely used.

## Locating the Public Collections

To access the **Public Collections** section, login to **KoboToolbox** and click
on the **Library** icon in the top-left section of your screen, and then
navigate to the **Public Collections** tab.

You will see a list of all public collections available on your respective
server instance as seen in the example below. The list shows an overview of the
collection name, number of items within each collection, owner, number of
subscribers, languages, specified primary sector, and the most recent date it
was modified.

If you are interested in a specific collection, there are several ways to find
what you need:

-   Browse by scrolling through all the available collections;
-   Use the search bar and type relevant keywords (see below). You can learn
    more about advanced searching [here](public_collections_advanced_search.md).

## Using the Public Collections

This section describes how to (a) subscribe to a collection, (b) use assets from
within a collection, and (c) how to add assets to a collection.

### a) Subscribing to a Public Collection

Subscribe to a public collection by either hovering over the list item and
clicking on the **SUBSCRIBE** button or by clicking on **SUBSCRIBE** from within
the collection’s detail view. This will then add the collection to the **My
Library** tab. You can remove the collection from your library by clicking
**UNSUBSCRIBE**.

### b) Using Assets within a Public Collection

Once you have identified the public collection you want to use, view its
contents by clicking on the list item. In the example below, we will search for
the word "example" and enter the first collection to see a list of all assets
available.

Select the group of questions you need within the public collection by hovering
the cursor over that group, which willhighlight it.

Once the asset is highlighted, you will find the icon to clone it on the right.
If you tap the three dots for more actions, you will see an option to download
the asset in either XLS or XML format.

![Example Detail 3](/images/using_public_collections/example_detail_3.gif)

If you need to add these questions to an already developed XLSForm, the best
approach would be to download the XLS version of the collection. You can then
manually add the desired questions by copying them over. Read more about
developing forms using Excel and XLSForm [here](edit_forms_excel.md).

Additionally, cloning the questions allows you to add to your personal library.
You can then
[add questions to the form within the Formbuilder](question_library.md).

### c) Creating a Public Collection

While you’re in the **Library** section of **KoboToolbox**, click on the **NEW**
button and a modal with four options will be displayed, as seen below.

![Create Library Item](/images/using_public_collections/create_library_item.png)

Tap the icon labeled **Collection**. You will then be prompted to enter details,
including a name for the new collection,which is required. Once complete, click
on **CREATE** to continue.

![Collection Details](/images/using_public_collections/collection_details.png)

If you intend to make the collection public, an _Organization_ and _Primary
Sector_ must also be defined.

Once the collection has been created, you will see the following options:

-   Make public, Modify details, Edit tags
-   Share the collection with specific users
-   Delete the collection

![Actions](/images/using_public_collections/actions.gif)

Start adding questions to the collection by moving them from the library. Hover
the cursor over the library assets then tap the three buttons to access more
options. You will see an option to move the questions to your collection.
