**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/b70cdbf084f645b5cefa1a9368456f8f37b7245c/source/gdpr.md" class="reference">17 Oct 2025</a>


## What is GDPR?

GDPR stands for [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu) and
is a new comprehensive data protection law in the EU that replaces existing laws
to strengthen the protection of personal data and the rights of the individual.
It is a single set of rules, directly enforceable in each EU member state.

We are fully compliant with the GDPR. If you are located in the European Union,
[you can sign a data processing agreement (DPA) here](https://www.digisigner.com/online/showTemplate?linkId=495db186-9c9e-4627-99f7-a943282eeab5).
