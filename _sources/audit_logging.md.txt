Audit Logging can be a useful tool to monitor enumerator behavior and discover
which questions are taking longer to answer, better understand how the
enumerators are navigating a certain form, and see which enumerators are
generally taking longer periods of time to submit answers.

<p class="note">This feature requires manually analyzing CSV files.</p>

The audit log meta question is a question type that is only supported by using
the [Collect Android app](kobocollect-android.md).

To add an `audit` meta question type to a form and view the finalized data,
please follow the steps below:

1. In an XLSForm file, add `audit` in the same fashion as you would any other
   meta questions. Then upload the form file to your project and deploy the
   form.

**survey**

| type  | name  | label                  |
| :---- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| start | start |                        |
| end   | end   |                        |
| audit | audit |                        |
| text  | Q1    | Q1. What is your name? |

2. Collect data using the [Collect Android app](kobocollect-android.md) and send
   the finalized forms back to the server. Collect saves the audit logs for each
   submission in a CSV file that are saved and uploaded to the server just as an
   attached photo would be.

3. After the data has been submitted, open your project in the browser and go to
   **DATA**, then **Downloads**. Select **Media Attachments (ZIP)** as the
   export type and then click on **New Export**. Once the download is done
   pending, click on the file to download it to your computer.

4. Once the ZIP file has been extracted and opened, click on the file labeled
   'audit.csv' to view the audit logs. It's important to note that the CSV uses
   [Unix Epoch](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php) time so the logs are
   recorded in milliseconds.

5. Because timestamps are saved for each individual submission, you will
   probably need to copy the values into a new spreadsheet to do further
   analysis across all submissions (e.g. by enumerator or by question).
   Collating many different CSV files into can be done by
   [many free tools or by writing a script](https://www.google.com/search?q=merge+many+CSV).

approach or script to use this feature so others can learn from your example.
