# Deleting a Project
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/511ea4cb3c698a4b45e7c2b4efd1af4e356e811f/source/delete_project.md" class="reference">15 Feb 2022</a>


There are two ways to delete a project and all of its data from your account.
Please note that once a project has been deleted, **THE ACTION CANNOT BE
REVERSED**. We do not store copies of your deleted projects, so make sure that
you have the correct project before proceeding and have all the data downloaded
first, if needed.

## Deleting Projects From Your Project Dashboard

In the Project Dashboard page hover over the far right side of the project you
wish to delete. Click the three dot icon (circled) that appears and then click
Delete. A dialogue box will appear that will require you to read and check a set
warnings, before deleting the project from your KoboToolbox account.

In the General window within the SETTINGS tab of the Project Page, click DELETE
PROJECT AND DATA. A dialogue box will appear that will require you to read and
check a set warnings, before deleting the project from your KoboToolbox account.
