**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/c5889af525a55f27747f919a026f9b7103f5c180/source/barcode_qrcode_questions.md" class="reference">24 Sep 2025</a>

The "Barcode/QR code" question type is used for scanning, decoding and capturing
barcodes and QR codes using the device camera. When a code is scanned with the
camera the value (whether numbers or text) stored in the code is captured.

management or item distribution. For example, you can scan a QR code on a
