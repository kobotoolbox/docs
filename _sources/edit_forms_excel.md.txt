# Editing Forms in Excel using XLSForm
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/b70cdbf084f645b5cefa1a9368456f8f37b7245c/source/edit_forms_excel.md" class="reference">17 Oct 2025</a>


KoboToolbox is building its forms using a widely shared standard called
[XLSForm](http://xlsform.org/en/). XLSForm makes it possible to create very
complex electronic forms in Excel (or any other spreadsheet program).

All forms created with KoboToolbox can be imported from or exported to XLSForm
files. This means they are fully compatible with other related tools such as
[ODK](https://opendatakit.org) or [Formhub](https://formhub.org).

Editing a form in Excel can be an easy way to quickly make several changes to a
form (for example for translating an entire form).

The XLSForm format is wonderfully documented [here](http://xlsform.org/en/).

When using XLSForm, you can create complex questions and forms, which are
introduced in this site.
