# Overview on Data Collection Tools
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/53c2e7dae53b8450c51194fb49c7d915fe735012/source/data-collection-tools.md" class="reference">11 Sep 2025</a>

KoboToolbox allows data collection in multiple ways. Because KoboToolbox is
built on the [Xform/ODK standards](https://xlsform.org), our forms are
compatible with
[a number of different tools](https://xlsform.org/en/#tools-that-support-xlsforms)
that can be used for data collection.

For Android devices, we recommend using
[Collect Andoid app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.koboc.collect.android&hl=en_US)
app, which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store and installed on any
standard Android phone or tablet.

For any other devices (including iPhones, iPads, or any laptop or computer), we
recommend using the webform [for collecting data](data_through_webforms.md).

## A quick rundown on the differences between the two options
