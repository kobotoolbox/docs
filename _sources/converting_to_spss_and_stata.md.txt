<p class="note">
  This article helps you convert your data into <strong>SPSS</strong> and
  <strong>Stata</strong>. Please note you that need
  <strong>IBM SPSS</strong> or <strong>Stata</strong> which are third party
  applications.
</p>

Since **KoboToolbox** does not export data directly in **SPSS** or **Stata**
format, this article will be a guide for you to make the conversion.

## Converting to SPSS

1. Download your data as XLS using the instructions provided in
   [this support article](export_download.md) or as illustrated in the image
   below.

2. Download the **SPSS Labels** from the same **DATA** tab as shown in the image
   below. This process will generate a zipped folder that contains the **SPSS**
   syntax.

3. You will now need **IBM SPSS** to import the data in XLS using the following
   method which is compatible with all versions of **SPSS**.

    - Within **SPSS**, click **File -> Open -> Data** (as below).
    - Once you click the **Data** tab, you will see a data box that will appear.
      In the **Files** of type box, select **Excel**.
    - Navigate to the folder that contains your **Excel** file, and find the
      **Excel** file that contains the data you downloaded.
    - Open the file, and youâ€™ll get the **Read Excel File** dialogue box.

4. Now open the syntax you downloaded in _Step 2_ and run the syntax.

You are now ready to manipulate your data in **SPSS**.

## Converting the SPSS file into a STATA file

Unfortunately we do not have an option to directly download an **SPSS DO** file.
You need to go through the above process then save the final data as a `.dta`
**Stata** data.

Ensure you choose to save all the options you need when saving.
