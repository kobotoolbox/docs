reset it easily.

To reset your password:

-   For organizations using the **Global Server**:
    Go to
    [kf.kobotoolbox.org](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org)
-   For organizations using the **European Union Server**: Go
    to [eu.kobotoolbox.org](https://eu.kobotoolbox.org)

-   Click **Forgot?** on the login form.
-   Enter your email address.
-   Click **Reset Password**.

KoboToolbox will then send out a password reset email after your request to
reset the password. If you didn't receive an email with the password reminder
link, please try troubleshooting with the following:

-   Check if our password reset email landed in your spam or junk mail folder,
    as it might have been placed there by your email provider.
-   Check if you created your account with a different email address - simply
    click on the 'Forgot' link again and enter your alternative email address.
-   It might also be that you are requesting to reset your password on the wrong
    server. Check the URL on your address bar to ensure you are on the server
    where you had created your account on,
    whether the [Global Server](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org) or the
    [European Union Server](https://eu.kobotoolbox.org]).

If you still have not received the email with the reset link, and you have tried
all the troubleshooting options provided above, please send an email with the
subject “Password reset issues” to
[support@kobotoolbox.org](mailto:support@kobotoolbox.org) with your username,
the email address you used to sign up, and which server you created your account
on.
