# Library locking
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/de5e7dcfcec534ba447ee21ff65cf9fff07723f2/source/library_locking.md" class="reference">30 Sep 2025</a>

"Library locking" refers to the feature enabling various aspects of a survey to
be "[locked](#locked)" when created from a template containing
[locking attributes](#restrictions). All aspects of a form's editing are
available to be locked through the assigning of "[locking profiles](#profile)"
at the form, question or group level. These locking profiles can be assigned
granular "[restrictions](#restriction)" that group together locking
functionalities. Alternatively, the form can be fully locked down, preventing
all aspects of editing.

<p class="note">
  Currently, only locking set within the XLSForm itself is supported, but will
  be incorporated into the formbuilder at some point in the future.
</p>

This feature may be useful in a large, distributed team setting where a standard
template is used, with some locked features, and each team can make necessary
local adjustments for their needs. The creator of the template can continue to
make updates, but the locks will restrict changes to specified aspects of the
form for those who [create a project based on the template](quick_start.md).

<p class="note">
  Locking aspects of a form is separate from

## Restrictions

There are three levels of restrictions that can be set:

1. [Question](#question-level-restrictions),
2. [Group](#group-level-restrictions), and
3. [Form](#form-level-restrictions)

Additionally, there is a `kobo--lock_all` boolean that can set in the `settings`
sheet that will render the survey completely locked.

### `kobo--lock_all` boolean

If `kobo--lock_all` is set to `True`, then all additional granular restrictions
are redundant as the form is _fully_ locked down. If it is set to `False` _or_
omitted from the `settings` sheet, then defined locking profiles can be used to
control the locked behaviour:

**settings sheet**

| kobo--lock_all |
| :------------- |
| true           |
| settings |

The accepted values for `kobo--lock_all` are the same as in the `survey` sheet
that
[pyxform supports](https://github.com/XLSForm/pyxform/blob/43ea039250f44cff23b3ad10740fca54dfa12383/pyxform/aliases.py#L127-L142).
No error will be thrown if an invalid value is used, only the form will not
function as intended from the user's perspective.

<p class="note">
  Note that the restriction name, such as <code>choice_add</code> below, is
  <strong>predefined</strong> and only the restrictions listed below are valid
  options.

## XLSForm configuration

There are three sheets where locking profiles are defined and set: `survey`,
`settings` and `kobo--locking-profiles`. The sheet of `kobo--locking-profiles`
is not officially supported by [pyxform](https://github.com/XLSForm/pyxform) and
is KoboToolbox-specific.

Form-level restrictions are defined in the `settings` sheet and question and
group-level restrictions are defined in the `survey` sheet.

From within the `kobo--locking-profiles` sheet, all the locking profiles are
defined in a matrix structure, using the keyword "[locked](#locked)" to assign a
"[restriction](#restriction)" to a specific "[profile](#profile)". For example:

**kobo--locking-profiles**

Define the profiles and assign them restrictions. There is no limit on the
number of profiles that can be defined (`profile_1`, ..., `profile_n`) but there
are **only three** colours that differentiate their locking appearance in the
formbuilder.

| restriction       | profile_1 | profile_2 | profile_3 |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| choice_add        | locked    |           |           |
| choice_delete     |           | locked    |           |
| choice_label_edit | locked    |           |           |
| choice_order_edit | locked    | locked    |           |
| form_appearance   |           |           | locked    |
| kobo--locking-profiles |

<p class="note">
  Note that not all valid restrictions need to be included in the
  <code>restriction</code> column, but an error will be thrown if an invalid
  restriction is included.
</p>

**settings sheet**

Set form-level restrictions and `kobo--lock_all` boolean.

| kobo--locking-profile | kobo--lock_all |
| :-------------------- | :------------- |
| profile_3             | false          |
| settings |

<p class="note">
  Note that omitting <code>kobo--lock_all</code> from the
  <code>settings</code> sheet is equivalent to setting it to <code>False</code>.
</p>

**survey sheet**

Set question and group-level restrictions.

| type                 | name    | label               | kobo--locking-profile |
| :------------------- | :------ | :------------------ | :-------------------- |
| select_one countries | country | Select your country | profile_1             |
| select_one cities    | city    | Select your city    | profile_2             |
| survey |

**choices sheet**

No restrictions can be set in the `choices` sheet.

| list_name | name      | label                    |
| :-------- | :-------- | :----------------------- |
| countries | canada    | Canada                   |
| countries | usa       | United States of America |
| cities    | vancouver | Vancouver                |
| cities    | toronto   | Toronto                  |
| cities    | baltimore | Baltimore                |
| cities    | boston    | Boston                   |
| choices |

### Import locked XLSForms

Import your XLSForm as a `template` through the KoboToolbox UI by navigating to
your **Library** and clicking on **NEW** and then **Upload**. Ensure that you
select `template` from the **Choose desired type** drop-down menu and then
import your XLSForm.

![choose template type](/images/library_locking/import-template.png)

The locked template will now show in your library list view with a lock symbol.

![library list](/images/library_locking/library-list-view.png)

### Create project from locked template

Once a locked template has been added to your library -- either directly through
importing an XLSForm as a template, creating a template based on a locked survey
or adding a locked template from the public collections -- you can create a new
project. In the **Projects** section of the UI, click on **NEW** and then **Use
a template**.

![create project from template](/images/library_locking/create-project-from-template.png)

-   Choose the locked template you want to use to create the new project.

![select template](/images/library_locking/select-template-for-new-project.png)

-   From there, continue to create the project.

![create project](/images/library_locking/create-project.png)

When this example locked template is used to create a new project, the
formbuilder will look like the following:

-   The grayed out areas are those that have been disabled through the
    restrictions.

![overview](/images/library_locking/formbuilder.png)

-   A dialogue box above the first question will show an overview of some of the
    form's restrictions.

![dialogue box](/images/library_locking/formbuilder-dialogue-box.png)

-   Each question with locking profiles will display, in its settings, which
    restrictions have been set.

![question restrictions](/images/library_locking/formbuilder-question-settings.png)

-   Some form-level settings will also be greyed out.

![form-level restrictions](/images/library_locking/form-style.png)

### Form validation

The following cases will currently throw a `FormPackLibraryLockingError`:

-   If a locking profile name (column header in the `kobo--locking-profiles`
    sheet) is "locked" (the same as the locking keyword)
-   If a restriction listed in `kobo--locking-profiles` is invalid (not in the
    list of [predefined restrictions](#restrictions))
-   If there is a sheet called `kobo--locking-profiles` but no `restriction`
    column
-   If no locking profiles are defined (column headers in the
    `kobo--locking-profiles` sheet)

<p class="note">
  Validation of the XLSForm library locking features will be expanded in the
  future.
</p>

### Caveats

In some spreadsheet editors, two single dashes (`--`) are automatically
converted to an m-dash (—), therefore making it difficult to type `kobo--` into
a cell. We therefore convert all instances of n- and m-dashes into two single
dashes (when prefixed with `kobo`). An XLSForm with the sheet name of
"kobo—locking-profiles" will be converted to `kobo--locking-profiles` and
similarly for the column headers.

## JSON representation

There are two attributes of the asset where locking information can be accessed
and modified: `asset.summary` and `asset.content`.

If `kobo--locking-profile` is a column name in the `survey` sheet, it will also
be listed in the `asset.summary.columns` array.

In `asset.summary`, the following two Boolean attributes describe an overview of
the form's locking structure:

-   `lock_all`, and
-   `lock_any`

The logic by which each of those Booleans are set is as follows:

-   `lock_all` is `True` _only_ if `kobo--lock_all` is set to `True` in the
    `settings` sheet, otherwise it's `False`
-   `lock_any` is set to `True` if _any_ of the following cases are `True`:
    -   `lock_all` is `True`,
    -   A `kobo--locking-profile` is set in the `settings` sheet, or
    -   _At least one_ `kobo--locking-profile` is set in the `survey` sheet

In the example above, the following will be present in the `asset.summary`:

```
{
  ...,
  "columns": [
    ...,
    "kobo--locking-profile"
  ],
  "lock_all": false,
  "lock_any": true,
  ...
}
```

In `asset.content`, an attribute of `content.kobo--locking-profiles` exists as
an array of JSON objects with the following structure:

```
[
  {
    "name": "profile_1",
    "restrictions": [
      "choice_add",
      "choice_label_edit",
      "choice_order_edit"
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

In `content.settings`, the following will be present in a JSON object:

```
{
  "kobo--locking-profile": "profile_3",
  "kobo--lock_all": false
}
```

And finally in `content.survey`, each question that has been assigned a locking
profile will have a `kobo--locking-profile` attribute as follows:

```
[
  {
    "name": "country",
    "type": "select_one",
    ...
    "kobo--locking-profile": "profile_1"
  },
  {
    "name": "city",
    "type": "select_one",
    ...
    "kobo--locking-profile": "profile_2"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Locking profiles and asset types

Of the four asset types (`survey`, `template`, `question` and `block`), only
`template`s and `survey`s handle library locking features and the locks are
enforced _only_ on surveys. Practically, this means the following:

Assume an XLSForm containing valid locking features is imported:

-   If imported as a `block`, then all traces of locking are excluded and/or
    stripped from the asset. This results in a `block` asset that will be
    equivalent to the same form uploaded without any locking features;
-   If imported as a `survey` (imported through the **Projects** section) or
    `template` then all locks are intact:
    -   If, from within the formbuilder:
        -   a question is added to the library, then all locks are stripped from
            the new `question` asset
        -   a group of questions is added to the library as a `block`, then all
            locks are stripped
    -   If a `template` is created _from_ the locked `survey` asset, then that
        `template` will inherit all the locks the `survey` had (but since it is
        a template, you are able to edit the contents in the formbuilder),
    -   If a `survey` is created _from_ a locked `template`, the survey will
        inherit all the locks that the `template` had

| Original Asset Type | Process/action                                     | Resulting `asset`'s Status |

※ These actions are not possible in the UI.

## Terminology

### `kobo--lock_all`

Attribute containing a Boolean value, set in the `settings` sheet and applies
all locking restrictions to the form and all questions and groups (rendering
granular locking profiles redundant).

### `kobo--locking-profile`

Column name in the `survey` and `settings` sheets where the locking profile is
assigned to a question or group (in `survey`) or to the form (in `settings`).

### `kobo--locking-profiles`

Sheet name where restrictions are assigned to profiles.

### `locked`

Keyword used to assign a restriction to a profile in the
`kobo--locking-profiles` sheet.

### Profile

The name assigned to a group of restrictions, defined in the
`kobo--locking-profiles` sheet. It is assigned to questions and groups in the
`survey` sheet and to the from in the `settings` sheet.

### Restriction

A granular locking attribute that can be assigned to a profile and control the
locking behaviour at the question, group or form level.

### Unlocked

A form containing no locking attributes.
