# Merging Individual Data with Roster Data through Power Query in Excel
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/73dbdbb56448bbfbdb62af8017b71582965291d2/source/merging_dataset_excel_power_query.md" class="reference">6 Apr 2022</a>


As illustrated in the support article,
[Grouping Questions and Repeating Groups](group_repeat.md), you can use
repeating groups to fulfil certain survey requirements. You may also need to
analyze data from the repeat groups that were collected. When
[downloading the data from the server (in XLS format)](export_download.md), you
should see the data in the following structure:

![Dataset Sheets](/images/merging_dataset_excel_power_query/dataset_sheets.png)

The first sheet with the sheet name **Repeat Group (Merge)** seen in the image
above holds the _individual data_ from the survey while the second sheet with
the sheet name **CR** holds the _roster data_.

<p class="note">
  For downloaded datasets, you should have one sheet more than the number of
  <em>repeat groups</em>. For example, if you had one
  <em>repeat group</em> included in the survey form, you should have two sheets
  in your dataset.
</p>

This support article will also illustrate the difference between _individual
data_ and _roster data_. It will then show the steps for how to merge them into
a single dataset through **Power Query** in **Excel**.

Merging _individual data_ and _roster data_ through the system is currently not
available but it is possible through **Power Query** in **Excel**. Excel was
chosen over other software because it is a widely used spreadsheet and available
to almost all PCs. It is also relatively easy-to-use.

## Differences between individual data and roster data:

_Individual data_ are information that are generally captured only once in an
interview. _Roster data_, on the other hand, are captured more than once _(e.g.,
details of all family members living within a household)_ from within the same
individual in an interview. The number of cases in _individual data_ may equal
to _roster data_ but can never exceed it, while the number of cases in _roster
data_ generally exceeds the _individual data_ but sometimes may be equal (but
never less).

A filled-up survey form, as shown below, should show in a picture the
differences between _individual data_ and _roster data_. _Please note, all data
used in this support article are hypothetical_.

![Form](/images/merging_dataset_excel_power_query/form.png)

<p class="note">
  Any data that is collected outside the repeat group is
  <em>individual data</em> and any data that is collected inside a repeat group
  is <em>roster data</em>.
</p>

Data downloaded in XLS format should also show the difference between
_individual data_ and _roster data_.

Each record _(as shown in the image below)_, under `Name of the household head`,
`Sex of the household head`, `Total family members in the household`, and
`Total school going children (aged 6-16 years) in the household` from the first
sheet **Repeat Group (Merge)** is _individual data_.

![Individual Data](/images/merging_dataset_excel_power_query/individual_data.png)

This example dataset has a total of 7 interviews as its _individual data_.

Similarly, each record _(as shown in the image below)_, under `Name of child`,
`Age of child`, and `Sex of child` from the second sheet, **CR**, is _roster
data_.

![Roster Data](/images/merging_dataset_excel_power_query/roster_data.png)

So, this example sample dataset has a total of 12 records as its _roster data_.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> While downloading a dataset from the server, you should
  also be able to see other variables (metadata variables) if they have not been
  filtered out. They have been removed from this example dataset for simplicity.
</p>

## Merging individual data with roster data:

If you look closely at the images shared above, you can see `_index` column with
value "1" in the first sheet **Repeat Group (Merge)**. Similarly, there is also
a `_parent_index` column with value "1" in the second sheet **CR**. `_index` and
`_parent_index` are additional variables created by the system to manage repeat
groups. They are matching variables needed to merge _individual data_ and
_roster data_ together into one.

Below are two approaches to merge _individual data_ and _roster data_ into a
single dataset through **Power Query** in **Excel**. You can use any of the
following approaches:

### First approach: Merging individual data with roster data (when the dataset is already open)

For the first approach, you must have opened your XLS dataset. For details,
please see the video below:

<video controls>
  <source
    src="./_static/files/merging_dataset_excel_power_query/xls_dataset_open.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

-   Open the dataset that has both the _individual data_ and _roster data_.

-   Select all data from the first sheet _(individual data)_.

-   Under the **Data** tab, select **From Table/Range**.

-   A dialogue box **(Create Table)** will pop-up. Select **OK**.

-   Select the **Close & Load** icon that is located at the top left corner of
    the screen. You should now see two dropdown options: **Close & Load** and
    **Close & Load To …**.

-   Select **Close & Load To …**.

-   A dialogue box **(Import Data)** will pop-up. Select **Only Create
    Connection** and then press **OK**.

-   You have now created a query table for the _(individual data)_.

-   You can now go to the second sheet, _(roster data)_, and follow the exact
    steps you have performed above.

-   With this you have created a query table for the _(roster data)_.

-   Under the **Data** tab, select **Get Data**. From there, select **Combine
    Queries** and then **Merge**.

-   A dialogue box **Merge** is seen.

-   Load both the query tables. Once both the tables are loaded, select the
    matching variable `_index` from the first table. Similarly, select the
    matching variable `_parent_index` from the second table. As soon as you
    select both the matching variables you should be able to see **The selection
    matches … of … rows from the first table**. The query table should now be
    merged.

-   To expand the merged table, check all the variables that you wish to have in
    the merged dataset. You can also uncheck **Use original column name as
    prefix** to have the original variable name in the merged dataset. When
    everything is done, select **OK**.

-   You should now have the final merged dataset.

-   Once again, select the **Close & Load** icon that is located at the top left
    corner of the screen. You should see two dropdown options: **Close & Load**
    and **Close & Load To …**.

-   Select **Close & Load**. With this final click you have merged your
    _individual data_ and _roster data_ into a single dataset.

### Second approach: Merging individual data with roster data (when the dataset is not yet open)

Use the second approach when you have not yet opened your XLS dataset and only
have opened your new Excel workbook. For details, please see the video below:

<video controls>
  <source
    src="./_static/files/merging_dataset_excel_power_query/new_excel_workbook.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

-   Open a new Excel workbook.

-   Under the **Data** tab, select **Get Data**. From there select **From File**
    and then **From Workbook**.

-   Search the file from your PC. Once you see it, select the file and then
    press **Import**.

-   A dialogue box **Navigator** is seen. Here, check **Select multiple items**
    and the sheet names **CR** and **Repeat Group (Merge)** that are visible.
    Once they are checked the **Load** button at the bottom of the dialogue box
    gets activated.

-   Select the **Load** button. You should see two dropdown options: **Load**
    and **Load To …**. Select **Load**.

-   With this, you have created query tables for the _(individual data)_ and the
    _(roster data)_.

-   Under the **Data** tab, select **Get Data**. From there, select **Combine
    Queries** and then select **Merge**.

-   A dialogue box **Merge** is seen.

-   Load both the query tables. Once both the tables are loaded, select the
    matching variable `_index` from the first table. Similarly, select the
    matching variable `_parent_index` from the second table. As soon as you
    select both the matching variables you should be able to see **The selection
    matches … of … rows from the first table**. The query table should now be
    merged.

-   To expand the merged table, check all the variables that you wish to have in
    the merged dataset. You can also uncheck **Use original column name as
    prefix** to have the original variable name in the merged dataset. When
    everything is done, select **OK**.

-   You should now have the final merged dataset.

-   Once again, select the **Close & Load** icon that is located at the top left
    corner of the screen. You should see two dropdown options: **Close & Load**
    and **Close & Load To …**.

-   Select **Close & Load**. With this final click you have merged your
    _individual data_ and _roster data_ into a single dataset.

<p class="note">
  The differences in the two approaches are with loading the query table. Once
  the query tables are loaded, you will need to follow the same steps to merge
  the <em>individual data</em> and <em>roster data</em>.
</p>

## Troubleshooting:

-   Exporting _repeat groups_ is not supported in CSV format. You will need to
    download the data in XLS format.

-   Microsoft Power Query for Excel is an Excel add-on. You can download it
    through this
    [Microsoft download site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379).
    It should work best on _Excel for Microsoft 365_ or _Excel 2021_, _Excel
    2019_, _Excel 2016_, _Excel 2013_, and _Excel 2010_. For more details,
    please check out the
