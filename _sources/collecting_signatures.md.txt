# Signature Question Type
**Last updated:** <a href="https://github.com/kobotoolbox/docs/blob/47cbc8887d6df73ef3bf760d5a3962b77ab26ed8/source/collecting_signatures.md" class="reference">29 Jul 2025</a>

Some forms may require signatures to be included with them. You can use
appearance `signature` on both Collect Android app and Enketo. The draw widget
is only available when using Enketo for data collection.

## Collect Android app

Collect allows for a digital signature to be collected directly on the screen of
the phone/tablet.

To add this to your form:

1. Open or download the XLS version of your form.
2. Create the question and set the type as `image`
3. Set the appearance to `signature`

## Enketo

Digital signatures also work on Enketo web forms, where you have the additional
option to use a draw widget to collect signatures. In your XLSForm just add
`signature` or `draw` under the `appearance` column for an `image`-type
question.
